### INTRODUCTION
Technology has always aided mankind in the continuous pursuit of greatness. It has become one of the greatest tools that assist people from all walks of life and remains one of the common denominators of change, no matter the decade.

As such, it rips off what we know and produces new pathways as the world emerges into a wave of evolution. 

True to its word, disruptive technology innovates normativity and replaces a product or a process despite its effectivity and tenure for new possibilities to happen. Simply put, disruptive technology changes solutions for specific improvements (SYDLE, 2022).

Moreover, disruptive technology redefines the way consumers, industries, and businesses operate using superior options despite limited resources (Smith, 2022). It is a natural selection that enables every kind of virtual citizen to continuously use the best selections in the market.

Coined by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen in 1995, disruptive technology helps underwhelmed markets by creating a good environment that attracts competitors and customers (Wright, n.d.). This will result in low-priced yet good-quality products.

Storage is an insatiable necessity, extending beyond households managing their possessions to businesses requiring warehouses for materials, among others. This perpetual need is mirrored in the realm of technology, where the demand for storage is unending. Whether for files, music, or photos, we resort to acquiring USBs, hard drives, CDs, and more to accommodate our ever-growing data.

Enter the cloud – not the one seen above in the sky, but a virtual domain on the internet. It serves as a remedy for storage challenges, representing one of the greatest innovations of the Internet age: cloud technology. This virtual space on the internet offers a solution to the constant quest for storage. It is a digital repository where individuals and businesses can deposit their software, applications, and files. It then revolutionizes how we manage and access our digital resources (Moutsos, 2023).

Within the realm of Cloud Technology lies cloud computing—an essential force responsible for delivering computing services across the internet. Utilizing this is more commonplace than one might think; activities such as sending emails, enjoying music, or streaming movies already harness its services. It covers a wide spectrum of spanning servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, all facilitated over the internet. This approach fosters swifter innovation, provides flexible resources, and capitalizes on economies of scale. The payment model is typically based on usage, allowing you to optimize operating costs, enhance infrastructure efficiency, and seamlessly adjust to evolving business demands (Microsoft Azure, n.d.).





### DEFINITION OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLOUD COMPUTING

### A. Why Cloud Computing Can Be Considered Disruptive

Does cloud computing live up to the hype? Can it truly be a disruptive technology? While the initial promises of speed, scalability, and cost savings were undeniable, the cloud has gone far beyond mere efficiency. It's not just revolutionizing how businesses operate– it’s reimagining entire industries. This unlocks a world of possibilities that were previously unimaginable.

Cloud-driven disruptive innovation is unfolding on two distinct fronts (McKendrick, 2016). Firstly, cloud-based software has made significant development in the technology industry. With these innovations came advanced computing resources which changed the game for smaller businesses, allowing them to stand closer to industries on a larger scale. This also enabled healthy competition and continuous technological advancements within the industry.

The second facet of cloud-induced disruption occurs at the business level. Cloud computing's impact on businesses goes beyond mere operational adjustments. It can seamlessly scale resources up or down based on demand, fostering a dynamic and responsive approach to market fluctuations. The cloud enables businesses to swiftly adapt to changing circumstances, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and navigate challenges with unparalleled flexibility.

However, the main disruptive nature of the cloud stems from its capacity to compel established players in the industry to rethink their business models, encompassing pricing strategies, sales channels, and fundamental technology structures (Satell, 2014). The disruption caused by the cloud serves as a driving force for organizations to reconsider old ways of doing things that have influenced industry standards for decades. Embracing this change becomes not only a survival strategy but a pathway to sustainable growth and relevance in an ever-evolving business and technological landscape.

### B. Provide an Example by Illustrating the Current Situation and Show How it Disrupts 
The cloud enables users to access information remotely around the world. Because of this, most product and service providers create or use online platforms to operate. Disruption from these platforms replaces face-to-face interaction and the need for particular jobs and physical equipment to function. For example, GrabFood and FoodPanda, both notably used food couriers in the Philippines, are favored more by employers over hiring private delivery personnel. In addition to the delivery function of the platforms, they also offer coupons and membership deals that greatly appeal to customers. As McKendrick (2016) notes, disruptive technology promotes itself in a way that seems lower in status compared to current trends but builds up to create new markets that make those trends eventually useless.

### C. Global Spending
Given the current pervasive influence of cloud technology across numerous companies and businesses, it is reasonable to anticipate its continual growth, evolution, and potential to overcome additional barriers in the future. In tandem with its expansion, the global expenditure on cloud computing technology is expected to steadily climb. Statista predicts its estimated value to reach 679 billion US dollars by 2024. This upsurge will have implications for various facets, including services, business processes, platforms, software, among others (Vailshery, 2023). Furthermore, Gartner envisions that by 2026, 75% of entities will readily embrace this digital transformation (Gartner, 2023). It seems inevitable that cloud technology will become a standard practice globally, with the remaining 25% transitioning to this norm in due course.

### CONCLUSION
The presence of disruptive technology allows consumers and businesses to use superior options in the market. Moreover, underserviced markets can attract more competitors and customers as they introduce new products with good quality despite their low or average markup and limited resources.

Cloud technology does not merely offer a solution to the perpetual storage challenge but revolutionizes how individuals and businesses manage their digital resources, fueled by the core principles of speed, scalability, and cost savings. Essentially, these principles trigger various paradigm shifts such as larger-scale competition for smaller businesses and the displacement of traditional delivery models by platforms like GrabFood and FoodPanda. These shifts not only challenges established norms but creates novel markets and opportunities. As a result, businesses, organizations, and companies are called to either adapt or risk their relevance in the face of an ever-evolving landscape. Cloud Technology has not only become a disruptive force in technology, but it has and proven to reimagine and reshape how industries function. With this, a new era begins, calling for change and modernity.
