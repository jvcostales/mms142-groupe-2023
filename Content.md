### INTRODUCTION

Storage is an insatiable necessity, extending beyond households managing their possessions to businesses requiring warehouses for materials, among others. This perpetual need is mirrored in the realm of technology, where the demand for storage is unending. Whether for files, music, or photos, we resort to acquiring USBs, hard drives, CDs, and more to accommodate our ever-growing data.

Enter the cloud – not the one seen above in the sky, but a virtual domain on the internet. It serves as a remedy for storage challenges, representing one of the greatest innovations of the Internet age: cloud technology. This virtual space on the internet offers a solution to the constant quest for storage. It is a digital repository where individuals and businesses can deposit their software, applications, and files. It then revolutionizes how we manage and access our digital resources (Moutsos, 2023).

Within the realm of Cloud Technology lies cloud computing—an essential force responsible for delivering computing services across the internet. Utilizing this is more commonplace than one might think; activities such as sending emails, enjoying music, or streaming movies already harness its services. It covers a wide spectrum of spanning servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, all facilitated over the internet. This approach fosters swifter innovation, provides flexible resources, and capitalizes on economies of scale. The payment model is typically based on usage, allowing you to optimize operating costs, enhance infrastructure efficiency, and seamlessly adjust to evolving business demands (Microsoft Azure, n.d.).





### DEFINITION OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLOUD COMPUTING


### CONCLUSION
Cloud technology does not merely offer a solution to the perpetual storage challenge but revolutionizes how individuals and businesses manage their digital resources, fueled by the core principles of speed, scalability, and cost savings. Essentially, these principles trigger various paradigm shifts such as larger-scale competition for smaller businesses and the displacement of traditional delivery models by platforms like GrabFood and FoodPanda. These shifts not only challenges established norms but creates novel markets and opportunities. As a result, businesses, organizations, and companies are called to either adapt or risk their relevance in the face of an ever-evolving landscape. Cloud Technology has not only become a disruptive force in technology, but it has and proven to reimagine and reshape how industries function. With this, a new era begins, calling for change and modernity.
