### Instructions
I. Decide on Your Topic
Select a Disruptive Technology that you will be reporting on. Once you have chosen your topic, you can post in the DF provided to claim it. There should be no duplication among groups.
Read:
https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/disruptive-innovation
https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation
https://hbr.org/2020/05/good-entrepreneurs-dont-set-out-to-disrupt

II. Research and Write about your topic
Your report should explain what disruptive technologies are in the context of your chosen topic.
You must explain why your chosen technology can be considered disruptive and illustrate what the current situation is and show how your chosen technology disrupts that. You may embed media and write different sections in your report as you see fit.

III. Publish your report using GitHub Pages
Create a repository with this naming format mms142-yourgroupname-2023 (ex. mms142-groupa-2023.github.io) You can use the themes or create your own from scratch. You may now populate your site with your report. This is where you will be using some HTML and CSS skills.

Each member of your group should have their own GitHub account and be added as a collaborator. If you have not used GitHub before, it will seem unwieldy at first but will get easier once you have grasped the basics.

I encourage groups to utilize GitHub's features, not just pulling and commit but other features such as Project (for project/task management) and Wiki (for documentation). Try to keep as much of your work within the GitHub ecosystem. I have encountered reports in the past of students who were supposedly excluded from group communications and materials. Keep everything documented in GitHub to avoid such issues, as these will reflect badly for your group. With GitHub, it will be possible to check the commits and pull requests to see how the work was done.

The following are the required topics in your Group DF in MyPortal. There may be other threads but I need to see these three.

 1. Topic Selection. This is where you will have a discussion to decide on your topic

 2. GitHub Usernames. This is where members will be sharing their GitHub usernames. I may refer back to this when I check the repositories.

 3. Planning and Announcements. This is where you will be posting all important announcements.

  Other threads such as roll calls, questions, or those soliciting for other external communication tools (again make sure no one is excluded from group chats) can also be created separately.

Submission
On the online text submission, submit a link to your site, and submit screenshots of your site under the file submission.
